PHP Minecraft Mod Manager

PHP Minecraft Mod Manager is a tool for modpack developers to keep track of their mods, create packs and scrape data from tools to keep their mods up to date.  It is designed to be modular.  It will by default check for mod updates on curseforge, but is open to other sites as long as they maintain the class structure of the curseforge library file.

It is currently a WIP and is not working.  Developers are welcome to help with the project.  Questions about a release date will not be answered.
